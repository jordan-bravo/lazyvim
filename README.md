# Jordan's Custom Neovim Config, built on LazyVim

## TODO

### High Level
 - [ ] Attempting to access registers (either via the " key or by typing :reg) causes nvim to lock up, only can escape with ctrl+c

### Low level

- [ ] Mason errors on startup
- [ ] Change tab/enter
- [ ] Bug: starting a comment (such as with # in a .nix file) causes indentation to decrease to zero
- [ ] Bug: hitting enter (new line) causes line to indent too much (example: when opening up brackets)
- [ ] Fix warning when opening .lua file: Warning. Client 1 quit with exit code 127 and signal 0
